# Crack64Bit

Minecraft seed cracking the practice of finding an exact Minecraft world from data from that world. This particular program is a series two programs to spilt the task of finding the world seed. We start the progam with some GPU programing with [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) in the file **Crack64Bit_The_Beginning** runs a defined set of data to spilt the possible structure seeds (the bottom 48 bits of a Minecarft worldseed).  This is retutured as a text file as a data pool to be filtered in second program **Crack64Bit_The_Sequel** to return useable world seeds.  This program is written in Java makeing use of the [Minecraft Seed Libarys](https://kaptainwutax.seedfinding.com/) devloped by user [Kaptainwutax](https://github.com/KaptainWutax).  


# Project Use
To run this project you will need a few things:

**-Patience**
This is finding a seed though brute force not the most efficient method be preapred to leave your computer running for a few hours. 

**-[The Nvidia Cuda Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)**

A fundamental part of this program is the use of parrel programing to find structure seeds. This is done by parrel programing made possible by the Nvidia Cuda Toolkit. By extension this also means you are required to have a Nvidia GPU to run this program.  

**-[JavaJDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html)**

Required for the second program, double check the varribles you would need a varrible "JAVA_HOME" is set to your Java JDK installed and the "PATH" varrible is set to the bin folder in your Java JDK folder.

**-[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)**

Build tool for Java. Used to incorporate the seed finding libarys into the Java program.  When installing Gradle it is imporant to make sure it is a compadible verrsion to Java, seen on the sites documentation. And **Gradle_Home** is set as a system varrible with the path set to the folders locasion on your system and and the bin folder added to the **"PATH"** varrible.

**-[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)**

This is an IDE to run Java code, allthough any programing environment _should_ work code is configured to work on this environment. 

When everything is installed you can run the first of this project by dowloading the zip file apart this Github respiratory. The two programs are combined because of their dependency on the other. The first stage of this project is found in the file **"Crack64Bit_The_Beginning"**. Use was desinged to be very simple drag the folder to your computers desktop and run the executeable file "GPU.exe" that does all the magic for you. You can see a screen recoding of this procsss [here](https://youtu.be/m_Qbvg5l4D8). 

After this proces you would recive a out.txt file. Compile this with the second program **"Crack64Bit_The_Sequel"**. You can do this by adding the file to your resources folder on IntelliJ IDEA. You can see a screen recoding of this procsss [here](https://youtu.be/vMJORczjRSk). 

This program is intentionally designed to be accessible in how it was uploaded. Changeing the program to filter for a diffent set of data follows that model. Starting with the first program the imporant files to edit would be the kernal. Without majoir exterior editing of the program the only thing you would need to chnage is the defined fortress's. 

```bash
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-9, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-10, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-11, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress (worldSeed,-12, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-6, 19))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-6, 18))continue;
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-6, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-6, 21))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-8, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress (worldSeed,-5, 39))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-5, 20))continue; 
  if (!fortress(worldSeed,-6, 22))continue; 
 
```
Currently this program is a list of Minecraft nether fortress chunk possions in our desired world. It is imporant to have mutiple data ponits to filter the output results so the second program is not overwhelmed. Very simple to replace the data ponits with relavent chunk possions, that would be the coordinates dived by 16.  
If you wish to search for another structure this is NOT the program for you because all the math is in terms of a Nether fortress from version 1.17. If you you wish to do so the [slats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) from previous to do so are listed below.    


The out.txt file is than compiled with the seoncd program to return the Minecraft world seed. 
Two things need to be chnaged on the Java program for finding your seeds.
First the list of chunk chunk possions realteing to your fortress, this should be the same as the first program. 

```bash
add(new CPos(-9, 20));
add(new CPos(-10, 20));
add(new CPos(-11, 20));
add(new CPos(-12, 20));
add(new CPos(-6, 19));
add(new CPos(-6, 18));
add(new CPos(-6, 20));
add(new CPos(-6, 21));
add(new CPos(-8, 20));
```


as well as 

```bash
add(new BPos(-196, 41, 233));
add(new BPos(-197, 42, 233));
add(new BPos(-199, 43, 233));
add(new BPos(-198, 40, 220));
add(new BPos(-200, 42, 222));
add(new BPos(-201, 41, 222));
add(new BPos(-201, 39, 221));
add(new BPos(-201, 38, 220));
add(new BPos(-202, 36, 218));
add(new BPos(-204, 35, 216));
	
```
