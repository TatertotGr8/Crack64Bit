# Crack64Bit

Minecraft seed cracking the practice of finding an exact Minecraft world from data from that world. This particular program is a series two programs to spilt the task of finding the world seed. We start the progam with some GPU programing with [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) in the file **Crack64Bit_The_Beginning** runs a defined set of data to spilt the possible structure seeds (the bottom 48 bits of a Minecarft worldseed).  This is retutured as a text file as a data pool to be filtered in second program **Crack64Bit_The_Sequel** to return useable world seeds.  This program is written in Java makeing use of the [Minecraft Seed Libarys](https://kaptainwutax.seedfinding.com/) devloped by user [Kaptainwutax](https://github.com/KaptainWutax).  


## Docmentation
To run this project you will need a few things:

**-Patience**
This is finding a seed though brute force not the most efficient method be preapred to leave your computer running for a few hours.

To run the first stage of this project download the zip file. 
Superate  the file "Crack64Bit_The_Beginning" from the group I would suggest to drag it onto you desktop. 
The executeable file "GPU.exe" does all the magic for you, click that and watch your power bill rise. 
You can see a screen recoding of this procsss [here](https://youtu.be/m_Qbvg5l4D8). 


After this proces you would recive a out.txt file.  Compile this with the second program "Crack64Bit_The_Sequel"
